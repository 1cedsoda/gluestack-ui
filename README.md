To use the `dank-style` in your project, follow these steps:

1. Wrap your application with the `StyledProvider` provided by
   **dank-style**.

```jsx
import { StyledProvider } from 'dank-style';

// Do this at the root of your application
function App({ children }) {

  import { styled } from '@gluestack/ui';

  const StyledButton = styled(
    Pressable,
    {
      baseStyle: {
        style: {
          bg: '$red500',
          p: '$3',
        },
      },
    },
    {}
  );

  const StyledButtonText = styled(Text, {}, {});

  export const App = () => {
    return (
      <StyledProvider>
        <StyledButton>
          <StyledButtonText>Button</StyledButtonText>
