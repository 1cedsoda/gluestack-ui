# Introduction

Universal Themed & [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) Styled Components for React, Next.js & React Native that you can copy paste in your apps. 

We are working on providing styled components using **nativewind** and **gluestack-ui**. Nativewind provides classNames based styling. These components are accessible, themed and you can directly copy and paste inside your application and customize it according to you project requirements.

This is not a component library as you cannot import components inside your application, to directly import components inside your application you can directly use [@gluestack-ui/themed](/ui/docs).
