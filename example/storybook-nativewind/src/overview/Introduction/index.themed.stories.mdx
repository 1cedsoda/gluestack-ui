# Introduction

[@gluestack-ui/themed](/ui/docs) provides universal, themed & styled components for React, Next.js & React Native but incase you application requires more design customization we are working on providing the option to directly copy paste the designed components into your application. 

These components use [gluestack-style](/style/docs) as styling engine that you can copy paste in your apps. gluestack-style is a styling engine that supports utility props.

This is not a component library as you cannot import components inside your application, to directly import components inside your application you can directly use [@gluestack-ui/themed](/ui/docs).
