# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using nativewind, please refer to nativewind [](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/guides/troubleshooting).

## Common issues.

### 1. "dark:" is not working as expected.

If you are using `dark:` and it is not working as expected, please make sure you have the followed this [docs](/home/theme-configuration/dark-mode).

### 2. Toast inside modal is not working.

If you are using `Toast` inside a `Modal` make sure to add `OverlayProvider` from `@gluestack-ui/overlay` to the root of your application.

```jsx

import { OverlayProvider } from '@gluestack-ui/overlay';
import {GluestackUIProvider} from '@/components/ui/gluestack-ui-provider';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <GluestackUIProvider>
      <OverlayProvider>
        <YourApp />
      </OverlayProvider>
    </GluestackUIProvider>
  );
};

```

### 3. Flashing issue in `Next.js`.

- go to [installation docs](https://gluestack.io/ui/nativewind/docs/home/getting-started/installation) click on manual. Go to step 4 check if everything is setup correctly.

### 4. tailwindcss classNames are not getting override with react-native-web.

- A simple fix is simply make the Tailwind styles a higher specificity. just add `important: 'html'` to your `tailwind.config.js`.

```jsx
/// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
    important: 'html',
  ...
}

```

## Known issues.

- `placeholder` is not working with css tokens.
- `dark:` is not working with "class" as a strategy.
