Theming in `@gluestack-ui with nativewind` is based on the [Styled System Theme Specification](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-specification).

## Colors

We recommend adding a palette that ranges from 50 to 900. Tools like [JSON Color Palette Generator](https://json-color-palette-generator.vercel.app), [Smart Swatch](https://smart-swatch.netlify.app/) or [Palx](https://palx.jxnblk.com/) are available to generate these palettes.

Below are the default color palette tokens provided in the gluestack-ui default config.
