## Overwriting

Overwriting of the default theme is important to create customizable designs, `@gluestack-ui-themed` components comes with a default base styling for all components, which is acheived when the components are wrapped with a Provider that takes in a theme file. `@gluestack-ui/themed` ships a theme created by team of designers after a lot of research. But what if there is a need to customise the base styling for all components or just the theme file. Don't worry we got you covered. `@gluestack-style/react` exports a createConfig function with help of which we can create custom config according to our design/design-system.

## Create Config

createConfig function takes an object as a parameter which takes in aliases, tokens, globalStyles and components object. To extend the default configuration provide by `@gluestack-ui/themed`, just import the pre-existing configuration from `@gluestack-ui/themed` and using the spread operator integrate it into the object sent in createConfig function.

- aliases: This is useful when you want to use a shorter name for a token. For example, you can use bg instead of backgroundColor for the backgroundColor token.

- tokens: This is where you define your design tokens. For more information refer [this](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/configuration/theme-tokens) doc.

- globalStyle: The styles written inside globalStyle are applied globally in the application.

- components: This is where you can define styles for different components based on keys. API will look something like this.

`  components: {
    Button: {
      theme: {
        bg: '$primary',
        variants: {
          primary: {
            bg: '$secondary',
          },
        },
      },
    },
    ButtonText: {},
  }`

> Note: This feature is still a work in progress and is not supported yet, we will release it soon.

```jsx
import { createConfig } from 'gluestack-style/react';
import { config } from 'gluestack-ui/themed';

const config = createConfig({
  ...config,
  aliases: {
    // ...
  },
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'blue',
      secondary: 'green',
      text: 'black',
      background: 'white',
    },
    fonts: {
      body: 'Arial, sans-serif',
      heading: 'Georgia, serif',
    },
    fontSizes: {
      small: '12px',
      medium: '16px',
      large: '20px',
    },
    space: { 0: 0, 1: 4, 2: 8, 4: 16, 8: 32 },
  },
  globalStyle: {
    // ...
  },
} as const);
```
