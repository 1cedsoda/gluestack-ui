## States

Styling of gluestack-ui components is done with help of [gluestack-style](https://style.gluestack.io/).

gluestack-style provides different features that help us to manage state, color mode, responsiveness and much more. Right now we will discuss how does gluestack style helps us to manage states like hover, active, focused etc.

Easiest way to change styling of states would be using sx prop which enables state management.

```jsx
import { config } from './gluestack-ui.config';
import { Button, GluestackUIProvider } from './components';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GluestackUIProvider config={config.theme}>
      <Button
        sx={{
          ':hover': {
            backgroundColor: '$red500',
          },
        }}
      >
        <Button.Text>Hello world</Button.Text>
      </Button>
    </GluestackUIProvider>
  );
}
```

We can define styles that can be applied on different states and pass them as an object in sx prop.
