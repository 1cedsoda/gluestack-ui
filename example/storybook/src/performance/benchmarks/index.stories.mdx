# Performance Benchmarks

`gluestack-ui` harnesses the power of [`gluestack-style`](https://style.gluestack.io), a universal and highly performant styling library, to create beautifully styled components. **With a babel plugin for pre-computing styles during the build process, and runtime performance optimizations, gluestack-style delivers high performance styling, even in the most demanding applications.**

# React Native

We performed the [benchmarks](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui-benchmarks) with some famous React Native libraries like gluestack-ui, tamagui, NativeBase, Styled Components and React Native built-in styling.

**In each case we have rendered 1000 components with styling of each library. Results are average of 5 mounts.**

> **All the benchmarks were measured in production enviornment on iPhone 13.**
