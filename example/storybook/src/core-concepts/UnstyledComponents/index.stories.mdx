## Unstyled Components

`@gluestack-ui/themed` is a component library which provides universal, accessible, interactive, styled components.

The accessibility, interactivity and other features of the components are provided by `@gluestack-ui`.
The styling of the components is done by using another library [gluestack-style](https://style.gluestack.io/).
The themed library with all the styled components in `@gluestack-ui/themed`.
We can use customised styles, theme tokens, dark and light mode, breakpoints etc with the help of `@gluestack-style`. In this guide we will take a look at we can use `@gluestack-ui` to create unstyled components with features like accessibility and interactivity.

> Note: Using Unstyled components is recommended incase you are building your own design system and want to create everything from scratch.

Lets try creating an unstyled Button component

We have a function called `createButton` which can be used to create a custom button component. This function takes in a configuration object which contains the styled components that you want to use for the button. You can refer [style.gluestack.io](https://style.gluestack.io/) for more information on how to use styled components. The createButton function takes an object which consists of the styled components that you can style according to your requirements. These styled components can be created using the `styled` function exported by `@gluestack-style/react`. The basic example is given below.

```jsx
import { createStyled } from '@gluestack-style/react';
import { ActivityIndicator, Pressable, Text, View } from 'react-native';
// import the createButton function
import { createButton } from '@gluestack-ui/button';

// Creating Styled Components by using react native components
const Root = createStyled(Pressable, {});
const Text = createStyled(Text, {});
const Group = createStyled(View, {});
const GroupHSpacer = createStyled(View, {});
const GroupVSpacer = createStyled(View, {});
const Spinner = createStyled(ActivityIndicator, {});

// Understanding the API
const Button = createButton({
  Root,
  Text,
  Group,
  GroupHSpacer,
  GroupVSpacer,
  Spinner,
});

// Using the button component
export default () => (
  <ButtonGroup>
    <Button>
      <ButtonText />
      <ButtonSpinner />
      <ButtonIcon />
    </Button>
  </ButtonGroup>
);
```

In the above example, we are creating an accessible, universal `Button` component by using createButton function exported by '@gluestack-ui/button' package. Using the API used by the function, we are creating different unstyled components and passing it to the function. Similarly, we have a different package and API for each component and we create styled components with help of `@gluestack-style/react` library and pass them in a object to the function.
API's for package is specified in the documentation of the respective components.
