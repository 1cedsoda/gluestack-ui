# Themed Library

The `@gluestack-ui/themed` component library starts has plain, unstyled components that don't have any specific look or style.

But, when you integrate it with the `@gluestack-ui/config` library, something interesting happens. This configuration library adds a particular style and design to these components. It has themes for all components. so now, these components look good and follow a specific design. These components are reusable, consistent, interactive and are accessible on web, iOS, and Android.

All the components of `@gluestack-ui/themed` are styled using theme exported from `@gluestack-ui/config`. This default theme ensures a consistent and polished visual identity. gluestack-ui simplifies the development process by wrapping your app within the `GluestackUIProvider` and passing the configuration as a parameter, you instantly unlock the magic of seamless styling.

## Architecture

We will try and understand how the components exported from `@gluestack-ui/themed` are created. Initially, we generate unstyled components using the [gluestack-style](https://style.gluestack.io/) styling engine. This allows us to customize styles, use theme tokens, provide styling for dark and light modes, and respond to different screen sizes using `@gluestack-style/react`. The specifics like themes, tokens, breakpoints and component themes are defined in a configuration file.

After that, we enhance the components with accessibility features, interactivity, and more using `@gluestack-ui`. This library provides creator functions that take our components and transform them into fully functional components. Once our components are both user-friendly and interactive, we bundle them together into a new package called `@gluestack-ui/themed`, which we can then easily use in our projects.

## Features

`@gluestack-ui/themed` uses `@gluestack-style/react` for styling components, it provides features such as:

- Tokens
- Themes
- Overwriting components base styles

`@gluestack-ui/themed` exports a config file that allows us to manipulate the theme tokens and add new themes. Theme tokens are standardized values that represent various design attributes, such as colors, typography settings, spacing, and more. These tokens serve as a consistent and centralized way to define and manage the visual properties of UI components across your application. Customizing these tokens can also be done, for more information refer to this [doc](/ui/docs/theme/customizing-tokens).

Support for multiple themes is also available. This can be achieved by updating the config file and adjusting the tokens accordingly for different themes.

Component styling is accomplished through [`@gluestack-style/react`](/style). You can customize the styles of each component, and detailed information related to that is available [here](/ui/docs/theme/customizing-components).

## Usage

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
    function App() {
      return (
        <GluestackUIProvider config={config}>
            <Button>
              <ButtonText>Hello world</ButtonText>
            </Button>
        </GluestackUIProvider>
      );
    }
`,
      scope: {
        Button,
        ButtonText,
        GluestackUIProvider,
        config,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>
