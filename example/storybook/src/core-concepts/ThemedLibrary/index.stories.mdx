Styling of the components is done by an [`@gluestack-ui/styled`](https://style.gluestack.io/). You can customize the styles of each component and detailed information related to that is available [here]().

Support for multiple themes is also available, this can be acheived by updating the config file and changing the tokens according to different themes.

Theme tokens are standardized values that represent various design attributes, such as colors, typography settings, spacing, and more.
