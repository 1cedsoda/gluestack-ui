# Universal

Central to `gluestack-ui` is its key feature: universality. This fundamentally transforms our approach to UI development, breaking away from the conventional method of distinct development for web and mobile platforms.

With `gluestack-ui`, developers can now craft beautiful interfaces with a single set of code that seamlessly operates across all devices, removing the need for the tedious and time-consuming process of crafting and maintaining two separate codebases for distinct platforms.

`gluestack-ui` is compatible with the popular frameworks, React, Next.js, Expo and React Native, allowing devs from all backgrounds to code universally.

## Design Considerations

You can also use `gluestack-ui` to create styles specific to a particular platform such as Web, iOS or Android. using `_web`, `_ios` and `_android` respectively.

```jsx
import { Button ,ButtonText} from 'gluestack-ui/themed';

function ButtonExample {

return (
  <Button _web={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }} _ios={{ backgroundColor: 'blue' }} _android={{ backgroundColor: 'green' }}>
   <ButtonText>Hello World</ButtonText>
  </Button>
)
}
```

While this feature is available, we advise against extensive utilization. Although this approach permits a tailored experience for each platform, it can introduce complexity and increased maintenance effort due to the necessity for extra logic in handling platform-specific props.

Therefore, finding the right equilibrium between delivering a personalized experience and ensuring a manageable codebase is of utmost importance.
