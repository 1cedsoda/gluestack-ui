# AlertDialog

An AlertDialog component is used to display a message to the user and prompt them to take some action, similar to the Alert component. However, the AlertDialog component is typically considered to be a more powerful and flexible alternative to the Alert component, as it can be used to create more complex dialogs with multiple inputs, custom layouts, and more.

In React Native, the AlertDialog component is typically generated using "styled views" and "overlays" to define the layout, visual design and behavior of the alert dialog.

## Styled Views

Styled views are used to define the layout and visual design of the dialog. They allow you to easily create a consistent look and feel for your component, while also making it easy to customize the design to match your app's overall style.

## Overlays

Overlays are used to handle the modal behavior of the dialog and ensure that it is displayed correctly on top of the other elements in the app.

Once you import and use the package, the component can be used in a similar way to the `Alert` component, with props such as `title`, `message`, `buttons`, `content` to customize the behavior and appearance of the dialog.
