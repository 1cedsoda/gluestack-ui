# Icon

"Icon" component is used to create an icon in React Native. In React Native, the Icon component can be generated using a third-party accessibility-focused library that uses "styled views" and "svg" to define the layout, visual design, and behavior of the component.

<Canvas style={{ height: 200 }}>
  <Story id="components-stories-icon--icon-story" />
</Canvas>
