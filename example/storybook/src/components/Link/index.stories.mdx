# Link

"Link" component is used to create a clickable hyperlink in React Native. In React Native, the Link component can be generated using a third-party accessibility-focused library that uses "styled views" and "text" to define the layout, visual design, and behavior of the component.

<Canvas style={{ height: 200 }}>
  <Story id="recipes-stories-link--link-story" />
</Canvas>
