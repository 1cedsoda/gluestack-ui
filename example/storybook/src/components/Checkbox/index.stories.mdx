# Checkbox

A Checkbox component is used to provide a way for users to select one or more options from a set of predefined choices. In React Native, the Checkbox component can be generated using a third-party accessibility-focused library that combines "styled views" and "pressable" to define the layout, visual design, and behavior of the component.

## Styled Views

Styled views are used to define the layout and visual design of the checkbox, such as its size, shape, border, and background color. They allow you to easily create a consistent look and feel for your component, while also making it easy to customize the design to match your app's overall style.

## Pressable

The pressable component is used to handle the user's interaction with the checkbox, such as a tap or click event, which will toggle the checkbox's selected state.

## Importing and Using a Third-Party Universal Accessibility Checkbox Component Library

This can be easily imported and used in any React Native project while providing accessibility features like screen reader support and other accessibility-related features.

When using a third-party library, the component can be used with props such as `label`, `checked`, `onValueChange` to customize the behavior and appearance of the Checkbox. You can also style the checkbox using the `style` prop, this prop accepts an object containing the styles of the checkbox.
