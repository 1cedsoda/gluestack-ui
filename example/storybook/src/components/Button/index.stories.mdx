# Button

A Button component is used to create clickable elements that perform an action when pressed. In React Native, the Button component is typically generated using "styled views" and "pressable" to define the layout, visual design, and behavior of the button.

## Styled Views

Styled views are used to define the layout and visual design of the button, such as its size, shape, border, and background color. They allow you to easily create a consistent look and feel for your component, while also making it easy to customize the design to match your app's overall style.

## Pressable

The pressable component is used to handle the button press event, which is triggered when the user taps on the button.

The component accepts several props such as `title`, `onPress`, `color`, `disabled`, `accessibilityLabel` to customize the behavior and appearance of the button.

You can also style the button using the `style` prop, this prop accepts an object containing the styles of the button.

It's important to note that the `Button` component is platform-specific, so it will look and behave differently on iOS and Android.
