# FormControl

"FormControl" component is used to create a container for form elements, like text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons. In React Native, the FormControl component can be generated using a third-party accessibility-focused library that uses "styled views" to define the layout, visual design, and behavior of the component.

<Canvas style={{ height: 200 }}>
  <Story id="components-stories-formcontrol--form-control-story" />
</Canvas>
