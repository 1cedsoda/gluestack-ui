# HStack

"HStack" component is used to create a horizontal stack layout for child components in React Native. In React Native, the HStack component can be generated using a third-party accessibility-focused library that uses "styled views" to define the layout, visual design, and behavior of the component.

<Canvas style={{ height: 200 }}>
  <Story id="recipes-stories-actionsheet--actionsheet-story" />
</Canvas>
