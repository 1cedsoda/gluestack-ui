# Menu

"Menu" component is used to create a menu of options that can be displayed on demand in React Native. In React Native, the Menu component can be generated using a third-party accessibility-focused library that uses "styled views", "Pressable" and "Text" to define the layout, visual design, and behavior of the component.
