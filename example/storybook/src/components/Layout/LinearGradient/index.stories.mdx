## Themed

Following is the default implementation of the **LinearGradient** component without any additional customization. This serves as a starting point for users who are new to this library and want to learn about the basic functionality and appearance of the component.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
<LinearGradient  colors={['$purple400', '$red400']} p="$5">      
  <Text color="white">
    This is a Box
  </Text>
</LinearGradient>
`,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Text,
        LinearGradient,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

### Import

To use the component in your project, run the command below into your import statement. This will import the component from your components folder.

```bash
import { LinearGradient } from '@gluestack-ui/themed';
```

### Anatomy

The structure provided below can help you identify and understand a Box component's various parts.

```jsx
export default () => <LinearGradient />;
```

### API Reference

The following section contains a comprehensive list of the component's references, including descriptions, properties, types, and default behavior. This information is readily available for you to access, helping you effectively utilize the component library in your projects.

#### LinearGradient

It inherits all the properties of Expo's [LinearGradient](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/linear-gradient/) component.

### Examples

The Examples section provides visual representations of the different variants of the component, allowing you to quickly and easily determine which one best fits your needs. Simply copy the code and integrate it into your project.

#### Button with Linear Gradient

A Box component with a ref property enables the direct reference and manipulation of the underlying DOM element, offering greater control and flexibility in modifying the box's appearance and behavior within a user interface.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
          <LinearGradient
      colors={['$fuchsia200', '$fuchsia800', "$purple400"]}
      borderRadius="$full"
    >
      <Pressable p="$4">
        <Icon as={EditIcon} color="$white" />
      </Pressable>
    </LinearGradient>
      `,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Pressable,
        Icon,
        EditIcon,
        LinearGradient,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

#### Card with Linear Gradient

A Box component with a ref property enables the direct reference and manipulation of the underlying DOM element, offering greater control and flexibility in modifying the box's appearance and behavior within a user interface.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
    <LinearGradient colors={['$purple400', '$blue400']}>
      <Box px="$6" py="$11" justifyContent="center" alignItems="center">
        <Image
          size="xs"
          w={265}
          source={{
            uri: 'https://ui.gluestack.io/_next/image?url=%2Ficon%2Flogo%2Fdark-mode.svg&w=384&q=75',
          }}
        />
      </Box>
    </LinearGradient>
      `,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Box,
        Image,
        LinearGradient,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

## Unstyled

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the LinearGradient

For customizing the LinearGradient, you have to map styled [LinearGradient](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/linear-gradient/) to LinearGradient. You can refer [style.gluestack.io](https://style.gluestack.io/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/linear-gradient` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/tree/main/example/storybook/src/components/Layout/LinearGradient) of the styled `LinearGradient` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/linear-gradient/styled-components';

// mapping the LinearGradient to root component
const LinearGradient = Root;

// using the LinearGradient component
export default () => <LinearGradient />;
```
