# IconButton

"IconButton" component is used to create a button with an icon in React Native. In React Native, the IconButton component can be generated using a third-party accessibility-focused library that uses "styled views" and "svg" to define the layout, visual design, and behavior of the component.

## Styled Views

Styled views are used to define the layout and visual design of the IconButton, such as its size, shape, color, and spacing. They allow you to easily create a consistent look and feel for your component, while also making it easy to customize the design to match your app's overall style.

## SVG

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector image format that can be used to create icons in React Native. SVG icons are resolution-independent, which means they will look crisp and clear on any screen size.
