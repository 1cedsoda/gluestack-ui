# NativeBase to gluestack-ui

## Manual Migration

`gluestack-ui` comes with major changes in philosophy as well as the API. With gluestack, we have re-imagined how we should code for React Native and the web. Therefore, you might encounter a few changes while migrating from NativeBase to gluestack-ui. Even though it might seem a bit of tedious work, we promise it will be worth it!
Please refer to [this](https://geekyants.notion.site/NativeBase-to-gluestack-ui-Migration-Plan-WIP-6409006d9ecc4fb2a559cca6117a3e7c) guide while migrating from NativeBase to gluestack-ui.

_Migration guide provided is a living document._

## Using the migration library

### Introduction

**@gluestack-ui/themed-native-base** is a drop-in replacement for `native-base`.

### Installation

To use `native-base` components with `gluestack-ui`, all you need to do is install the `@gluestack-ui/themed-native-base` package:

```sh
$ yarn add @gluestack-ui/themed-native-base

# or

$ npm i @gluestack-ui/themed-native-base
```

### Usage

Just change your import from `native-base` to `Gluestack-ui/themed-native-base`, and all the components along with provider will work as is.

If you want it to work with nextJS you will need to use the `withGluestackUI` adapter in NextJS.

- install the `@gluestack/ui-next-adapter` package.
- update the `next.config.js` file like this.

```
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */

const { withGluestackUI } = require("@gluestack/ui-next-adapter")

const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ["@gluestack-ui/themed-native-base"],
}

module.exports = withGluestackUI(nextConfig)
```

- add `gs` className to Html tag and add flush function from `@gluestack-style/react` in your `_document` file like this

```
import * as React from 'react';
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native-web';
import { flush } from '@gluestack-style/react';

function Document() {
  return (
    <Html className="gs" lang="en">
      <Head />
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
}

Document.getInitialProps = async ({ renderPage }: any) => {
  AppRegistry.registerComponent('Main', () => Main);
  const { getStyleElement } = AppRegistry.getApplication('Main');
  const page = await renderPage();
  const styles = [getStyleElement(), ...flush()];
  return { ...page, styles: React.Children.toArray(styles) };
};

export default Document;
```
