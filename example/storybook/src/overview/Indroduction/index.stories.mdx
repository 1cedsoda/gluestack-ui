# Introduction

Dank is a performant styling CSS-in-JS library for React and React Native that enables developers to write maintainable and scalable styles in a fast and efficient manner.

## Why we built dank.style?

We have seen great CSS-in-JS libraries on the web, like — glamour, emotion, styled-components, and the recently announced Vanilla-extract (typed & a compiler, yay!). A few of them also support React Native, making them universal.

But, dank is built with a React Native first & universal approach while not compromising the performance on the web. All the style computation happens at compile-time with a babel-plugin that minimizes the runtime overhead. In fact, with SSR / SSG, pages built with dank can run with Zero JS on the client (including the media queries).

This project primarily started as a part of NativeBase, a universal component library built for React Native and Web. But, we realized that not everyone would need everything from the component library, so we broke it down into three separate libraries.

- [dank.style](http://dank.style) - Universal & Performant CSS-in-JS library
- [universa11y.dev](http://universa11y.dev) (coming soon) - A set of HOCs that adds accessibility to low-level [dank.style](http://dank.style) components or any component with the same prop type
- gluestack-ui (coming soon) - A suite of high-quality, ready-to-use universal components that can be dropped into any project and styled as per the needs. We can eject the components to style any part of the component

## But aren’t React Native and React Native Web sufficient?

Dank and React Native Web aren’t directly comparable as they are different.

React Native Web has two parts

- A set of low-level components
- A CSS-in-JS library to style those components

Whereas dank is a styling library

- A CSS-in-JS library to style any given React / React Native component
- A theming soluton (improve this writing)
- Each component built with dank can be styled with
  - Tokens
  - Variants
  - Media Queries
  - States (hover, focus, etc)
  - Platform
  - Color Mode
  - …

React Native Web is great! Dank needs React Native Web’s “components” to build universal components.

But, Dank doesn’t use React Native Web’s styling engine (which is highly performant)! Dank’s babel-plugin (compiler) precompiles the declarative styling object into CSS classes and declarations and injects them directly during compile-time leading to zero style calculation during the runtime.

## Why we built it when we already have NativeBase?

This library was a part of NativeBase. This isn’t directly comparable with NativeBase. Dank only deals with the styling while NativeBase is a component library with styling, accessiblity and a default theme, all built-in.

## Goals

- Universal CSS-in-JS solution (implementation per platform can differ)
- Consistent API for developers
- Solve CSS Specificity
- TypeScript everything
- Styling for
  - Theme / token
  - Variants
  - Media Queries
  - States
  - Platform based styling
  - Color Mode
- Composable (should work with other libraries)

## Non goals

- Don’t solve problems beyond styling!
- Accessibility (check universa11y.dev)
- Design (check gluestack-ui)
- Animation (check examples with Legend-Motion)

## Under consideration (not a roadmap)

- Dank to support other libraries & frameworks — Solid, Svelte, Vue, Astro or Qwik
- Bundler plugin (instead of the babel-plugin)
  - To generate separate CSS files
  - To remove intermediate components when it makes sense

## Gotchas

Though this is internal to the library, it’s great if you know the following:

- Dank generates pure CSS for media-queries
- media-query color-mode-preferences isn’t supported right now.
- Dank generates CSS classes & declarations for the rest. It doesn’t use the default CSS’s way of handling pseudo states. For eg, we don’t use CSS pseudo selector like `:hover`, the hover logic is left to the developer to implement in the JS runtime. The primary reason for that is to have a better control of user interactions and handle it with logic whenever needed (like to use Legend-Motion in the hover state).

Dank generates indepedent CSS class declarations for the following in the correct “order of specificity” after “resolving the theme tokens”. - Variants - States (hover, focus, …) - Color Mode
