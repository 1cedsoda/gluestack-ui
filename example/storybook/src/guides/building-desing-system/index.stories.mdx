## Building Design Systems

Empower your development by creating a personalized design system with `gluestack-ui`.
This enables you to build your own collection of components that match your vision.

### Step 1: Create

[`@gluestack-ui/themed` â€“ a meticulously organized monorepo](https://https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui). Begin shaping your design system by **forking** this [solid](https://https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui) foundation.

- This repo has a component library package `@gluestack-ui/themed` in `packages/themed`
- This repo has a storybook setup in `example/storybook` for both React and React Native.

To create your own design system using `gluestack-ui`, follow these steps after forking the repository:

- Change library name

  - Navigate to the `packages/themed` of your forked repository and open `package.json`. (You can rename the folder if you need)
  - Locate the name field in th `package.json` file and update it to `@myapp/components`

  ```json
  //package.json
  {
    "name": "@myapp/components"
    // ...
  }
  ```

- Update `tsconfig` and `babel.config.js` in `example/storybook`.

Now your library `@myapp/components` has all primitive components from `@gluestack-ui/themed` by default.

### Step 2: Configuration

### Theme Tokens

Theme tokens and other configuration is present in `packages/themed/src/components/gluestack-ui.config.ts`. You have the flexibility to modify these tokens as per your requirements.

Check [this](/docs/theme/customizing-theme) for more details.

### Components

You can customize the styling of all primitive components. All styling exist in `<ComponentName>/styled-components` for a particular component. You can add and modify property value and variants based on your need.

**Create a custom component**

- Create a folder inside `components/Circle`
- Create a folder for all styling `styled-components/`
- Write styling for the component in `Root.tsx`

```jsx
export const Root = styled(View, {
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  borderRadius: '$full',
  overflow: 'hidden',
  variants: {
    size: {
      large: {
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

For other like accessibility, events and other hooks create an `index.tsx` file and export it.

```jsx
import { Root } from './styled-components';

const Circle = (props) => {
  return <Root {...props}>{props.children}</Root>;
};
```

And then export from `index.tsx`

```jsx
export * from './Circle';
```

### Step 3: Test

In your storybook, now you can import `Circle` component from your `@myapp/components`.

```jsx
import { Circle } from '@myapp/components';
export default () => <Circle size="large" />;
```

### Step 4: Publish

Now you can publish your design system as a package from `packages/themed`.

### Step 5: Use

Once published, you can use `@myapp/components` in your app you need add it to your `package.json` and update your configuration.

#### Next.js

Update **_next.config.js_**:

```jsx
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const { withGluestackUI } = require('@gluestack/ui-next-adapter');

const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ['@myapp/components'],
};

module.exports = withGluestackUI(nextConfig);
```

#### Expo

No need to update any config for Expo.
