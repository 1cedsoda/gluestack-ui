## Building Design Systems

Empower your development by creating a personalized design system with `gluestack-ui`.
This enables you to build your own collection of components that match your vision.

## Step 1: Create

`@gluestack-ui/themed` â€“ a meticulously organized monorepo. Begin shaping your design system by building upon this solid foundation.

To create your own design system using gluestack-ui, follow these steps after forking the repository:

### Rename library name

- Open package.json - navigate to the root of your forked repository.
- Change library name

* Locate the name field in th package.json file and update it to `@myapp/components`

```json
//package.json
{
  "name": "@myapp/components"
  // ...
}
```

- This library will have all primitive components from `@gluestack-ui/themed` by default.

## Step 2: Configuration

### Theme Tokens

- To configure theme and tokens you need to follow this documentation

### Components

- Create a custom component.

* create a folder inside `components/Circle`
* create a folder for all styling `styled-components`
* write styling for the component in `Root.tsx`

```jsx
export const Root = styled(View, {
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  borderRadius: 'full',
  overflow: 'hidden',
});
```

- For other like accessibility, events and other hooks create an index.tsx file and export this from here

```jsx
import { Root } from './styled-components';

const Circle = (props) => {
  return <Root {...props}>{props.children}</Root>;
};
```

- And then export from index.tsx:

```jsx
export * from './Circle';
```

## Step 3: Build

Now in you app add `@myapp/components` to your package.json and update your configuration.

`next.config.js`

## Step 4: Test

In you app now you can import `Circle` component.

```jsx
import { Circle } from '@myapp/components';
export default () => <Circle size="$large" />;
```
