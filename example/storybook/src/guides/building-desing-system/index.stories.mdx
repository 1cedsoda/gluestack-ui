## Building Design Systems

Empower your development by creating a personalized design system with `gluestack-ui`.
This enables you to build your own collection of components that match your vision.

## Step 1: Create

`@gluestack-ui/themed` â€“ a meticulously organized monorepo. Begin shaping your design system by building upon this solid foundation.

- This repo has a component library package `@gluestack-ui/themed` in `packages/themed`
- This repo has a storybook setup in `example/storybook` for both React and React Native.

To create your own design system using gluestack-ui, follow these steps after forking the repository:

- Change library name

* Open package.json-
  navigate to the `packages/themed` of your forked repository. (You can rename the folder if you need)

* Locate the name field in th package.json file and update it to `@myapp/components`

```json
//package.json
{
  "name": "@myapp/components"
  // ...
}
```

- Update `tsconfig` and `babel.config.js` in `example/storybook`.

- Now this library has all primitive components from `@gluestack-ui/themed` by default.

## Step 2: Configuration

### Theme Tokens

- To configure theme and tokens you need to follow this documentation

### Components

- Customize a primitive component
  You can customize styling of all primitive components.

* All styling exist in `<ComponentName>/styled-components` for a particular component. You can add and modify property value and variants based on your need.

- Create a custom component.

* create a folder inside `components/Circle`
* create a folder for all styling `styled-components`
* write styling for the component in `Root.tsx`

```jsx
export const Root = styled(View, {
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  borderRadius: '$full',
  overflow: 'hidden',
  variants: {
    size: {
      large: {
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

- For other like accessibility, events and other hooks create an index.tsx file and export this from here

```jsx
import { Root } from './styled-components';

const Circle = (props) => {
  return <Root {...props}>{props.children}</Root>;
};
```

- And then export from index.tsx:

```jsx
export * from './Circle';
```

## Step 3: Test

In your storybook now you can import `Circle` component from your `@myapp/components` in storybook

```jsx
import { Circle } from '@myapp/components';
export default () => <Circle size="large" />;
```

## Step 4: Publish

Now you can publish your design system.

## Step 5: Usage

Now to use `@myapp/components` in your app you need add it to your package.json and update your configuration.

`next.config.js`

```jsx
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const { withGluestackUI } = require('@gluestack/ui-next-adapter');

const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ['@myapp/components'],
};

module.exports = withGluestackUI(nextConfig);
```
