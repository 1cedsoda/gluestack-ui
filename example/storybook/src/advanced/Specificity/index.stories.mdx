# Specificity

The specificity of a style is a measure of how specific a style rule is to a selected element. In CSS, specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector.

Dank provides a specific approach to resolving specificity for its style ids to ensure predictable and efficient style application. Dank uses a combination of static and dynamic specificity to generate unique and predictable style ids. The static part of specificity is determined by the component type and any base styles that are applied. The dynamic part is generated based on any props that are passed to the component, such as the states prop used to apply hover, active, and focus styles.

For example, a button component may have a base style with a specific `fontSize` and `backgroundColor`. If a primary variant is applied to the button, Dank will attach a new style id with higher specificity than the base style id. This ensures that the primary styles are applied in addition to the base styles, rather than overwriting them.

### Architecture

Dank calculates styles during build time by generating CSS declaration blocks and storing them as objects in memory. These styles are then assigned a unique identifier (styleId) which is stored in a map along with information about the styles, such as state and color mode.

During runtime, when a component is rendered, Dank retrieves the styleId from the map based on the component's props (such as the state or color mode) and attaches it to the component as a data-style attribute for web or pushes a new stylesheet object for React Native.

Dank uses a system of cascading and specificity to determine which styles to apply to a component. For example, if a component has a state and a color mode, Dank will first look for styles with both the specific state and color mode, then fallback to styles with just the state or just the color mode, and finally fallback to the base styles if no matching styles are found.

Dank also supports nested styles and compound variants, which allows for more complex and dynamic styling based on multiple conditions.

Overall, Dank's approach to styling is designed to be performant and efficient by minimizing the amount of calculations that need to be done during runtime while still allowing for dynamic and flexible styles.
