# Command Line Interface (CLI) Guide

`@gluestack-ui/react` is a component library which provides universal, accessible, interactive, styled components.

- The accessibility, interactivity and other features of the components are provided by `@gluestack-ui/react`.

- The styling of the components is done by using another library [gluestack-style](https://style.gluestack.io/). We can use customised styles, theme tokens, dark and light mode, breakpoints etc with the help of `@gluestack-style`

By default gluestack-ui components comes with a default base styling for all components, which is acheived when the components are wrapped with a Provider that takes in a theme file. `@gluestack-ui/react` ships a theme created by team of designers after a lot of research. But what if there is a need to customise the base styling for all components or just the theme file. Don't worry we got you covered.

`gluestack-ui-scripts` is another library that provides a set of commands that manipultes `@gluestack-ui/react`. We need to install the scripts package first.

```bash

yarn add gluestack-ui-scripts

npm i gluestack-ui-scripts

```

It exports an `eject` command that

- ejects all the components and gluestack-ui theme in `gluestack-ui-components` folder.
- For Next Apps an alias of '@gluestack-ui/react' is added which will use the components from `./components` now.

```bash

# ejects all the components and the config file
yarn gluestack-ui-scripts eject

npm run gluestack-ui-scripts eject

```
