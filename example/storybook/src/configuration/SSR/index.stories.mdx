# Server-Side Rendering

Dank provides support for server-side rendering (SSR) by exporting a **`flush`** function. The **`flush`** function is used to flush out any styles that were generated during the server-side render process, so that they can be added to the HTML document.

To use the **`flush`** function, you need to import it and call it in the **`_document.js`** file. The **`_document.js`** file is a Next.js specific file that is used to customize the document that is sent to the browser.

To prevent flickering, the `gs` class should be attached, which increases the specificity of any inline styles that are being used.

Here is an example of how you can use the **`flush`** function in the **`_document.js`** file:

```jsx
import { flush } from '@dank-style/react';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html className="gs">
        <Head></Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export async function getInitialProps({ renderPage }: any) {
  AppRegistry.registerComponent('Main', () => Main);
  const { getStyleElement } = AppRegistry.getApplication('Main');
  const page = await renderPage();
  const styles = [
    <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: style }} />,
    getStyleElement(),
    ...flush(),
  ];
  return { ...page, styles: React.Children.toArray(styles) };
}

Document.getInitialProps = getInitialProps;

export default MyDocument;
```

In this example, we are importing the **`flush`** function and calling it in the **`getInitialProps`** method. The method returns the initial props and the styles that are generated. The styles are then added to the HTML document by creating multiple **`style`** tags for all the styles.

It's important to note that when using the **`flush`** function, you will need to make sure that the **`flush`** function is called after the React tree is rendered on the server, so that the styles are correctly flushed.

By using the **`flush`** function, you can ensure that your styles are correctly rendered on the server, which will improve the performance of your application.
