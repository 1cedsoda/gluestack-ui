# SSR

Dank provides support for server-side rendering (SSR) by exporting a **`flush`** function. The **`flush`** function is used to flush out any styles that were generated during the server-side render process, so that they can be added to the HTML document.

To use the **`flush`** function, you need to import it and call it in the **`_document.js`** file. The **`_document.js`** file is a Next.js specific file that is used to customize the document that is sent to the browser.

Here is an example of how you can use the **`flush`** function in the **`_document.js`** file:

```jsx
import { flush } from 'dank-style';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);
    const styles = flush();
    return { ...initialProps, styles };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
          <style
            data-styled-components={styles}
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: styles }}
          />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

In this example, we are importing the **`flush`** function and calling it in the **`getInitialProps`** method. The method returns the initial props and the styles that are generated. The styles are then added to the **`Head`** component of the HTML document by creating a **`style`** tag with the **`data-styled-components`** attribute.

It's important to note that when using the **`flush`** function, you will need to make sure that the **`flush`** function is called after the React tree is rendered on the server, so that the styles are correctly flushed.

By using the **`flush`** function, you can ensure that your styles are correctly rendered on the server, which will improve the performance of your application.
