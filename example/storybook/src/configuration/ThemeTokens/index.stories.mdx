## Theme Tokens

To utilize theme tokens, create a config object in `gluestack-style.config.ts/js` at your app's root level, including all the design tokens you intend to use in your application. Here is an example of a theme object:

```js
import { createConfig } from 'gluestack-style/react';

const config = createConfig({
  aliases: {
    bg; 'backgroundColor',
    p: 'padding',
    h: 'height',
    w: 'width',
  },
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'blue',
      secondary: 'green',
      text: 'black',
      background: 'white',
    },
    fonts: {
      body: 'Arial, sans-serif',
      heading: 'Georgia, serif',
    },
    fontSizes: {
      small: '12px',
      medium: '16px',
      large: '20px',
    },
    space: { 0: 0, 1: 4, 2: 8, 4: 16, 8: 32 },
  },
  globalStyle: {
    // ...
  },
} as const);
```

This example's theme object encompasses various properties for colors, fonts, font sizes, and spacing. You can add as many properties as you need, such as typography, border radius, shadows, etc. You can refer to [gluestack-style](https://style.gluestack.io/docs/configuration/theme-tokens) for more information on the available properties.

## Update config

To update the config, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx gluestack-ui@latest
```
