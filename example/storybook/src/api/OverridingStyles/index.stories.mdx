# Overriding styles with sx

Dank supports the use of an **`sx`** prop to override styles. The **`sx`** prop allows you to pass an object that supports tokens, media-queries, nesting and token-aware values to the component.

`sx` accepts the same style object as theÂ base style.

```tsx
<Button
  size="lg"
  sx={{
      "marginBottom": '$4',
      "bg": 'pink',
      ":hover": {
          "bg": 'orange',
      },
  }}
>
  <Button.Text>Button</Button.Text>
<Button>
```

In this example, the button will have a pink background instead of default primary, because we have overridden the backgroundColor style by passing it in the **`sx`** prop.

The **`sx`** prop is particularly useful when working with theming and responsive styles, as it allows you to easily change the styles of a component based on the theme or viewport size.

It is also important to note that you should always avoid using `sx` prop as it adds to the complexity of style calculations and hence decreases your performance.
