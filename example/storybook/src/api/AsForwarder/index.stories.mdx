# AsForwarder

Dank Style exports a **`AsForwarder`** component that can be used to configure the library.

**`AsForwarder`** is used to render the component passed in as prop with styling added by styled function.

Here is an example of how you can use the **`AsForwarder`** component to configure the library:

```jsx
const StyledIcon = styled(
  AsForwarder,
  {
    variants: {
      size: {
        xs: {
          props: {
            h: 12,
            w: 12,
          },:
        },
        sm: {
          props: {
             h: 16,
            w: 16,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    ancestorStyle: ['_icon'],
  },
);

export function Example() {
  return (
    <StyledIcon as={HomeIcon} size="xs" />
  );
}
```
