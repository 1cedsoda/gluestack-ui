# Utility Props

We know the whole structure of writing your styles in `sx` props way is a bit tricky to learn hence we also provide you with the ability to pass down utility props on any Styled Component, we internally convert this to `sx` prop (We are also working on a babel plugin that does this at build time to save time for this conversion).

### How to write utility props?

There is a simple rule, all the utility props are the final property you want to get attached on the style of your component, It will override all other stylings except `style` prop. Here is a demo of the syntax.

```jsx
<StyledView borderColor="$grey600" bg="$grey700" borderRadius="$md" />
```

This will turn into :

```jsx
<StyledView
  sx={{ borderColor: '$grey600', bg: '$grey700', borderRadius: '$md' }}
/>
```

> Warning: However like all good things writing inline styles take a toll on performance. So we highly recommend you keep it to a minimum.
