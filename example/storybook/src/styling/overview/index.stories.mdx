# Styling Overview

All the components of `@gluestack-ui/themed` by default are unstyled. Default styling is provided by `@gluestack-ui/config`, Attaching those styles is taken care of by our styling engine [@gluestack-style/react](/style/docs/overview/introduction) and it is defined in [`gluestack-ui.config.ts`](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/main/packages/themed/src/components/gluestack-ui.config.ts) file. Config file exports an object which is passed inside the `GluetackUIProvider`(a Wrapper component that applies the theme to all the children).

```jsx
import { GluestackUIProvider } from '@gluestack-ui/themed';
import { config } from '@gluestack-ui/config';

function App({ children }) {
  return <GluestackUIProvider config={config}>{children}</GluestackUIProvider>;
}
```

The imported config contains a theme object which contains all the configuration, the structure looks something like the following:

```bash
{
  "theme": {
    "aliases": {
      # Adding bg as alias of background Color
      "bg": "backgroundColor"
    },
    "tokens": {
      # All the tokens are defined here like colors, borderWidths, radii, breakpoints, mediaQueries ....
    },
    "globalStyle": {
      # All the global style is defined here
    }
  }
}
```

The theme object has aliases, tokens and global style.

- aliases: This is useful when you want to use a shorter name for a token. For example, you can use bg instead of backgroundColor for the backgroundColor token.

- tokens: This is where you define your design tokens. Tokens helps us to maintain consistent designs.

- globalStyle: The styles written inside globalStyle are applied globally in the application.
