# StyledProvider

- Dank Style exports a **`StyledProvider`** component that can be used to configure the library.
- The **`StyledProvider`** component is a higher-order component that wraps your entire application and provides the library's configuration options through its **`config`** prop.
- You can use the **`StyledProvider`** component to set global options, such as breakpoints and theme.
- Here is an example of how you can use the **`StyledProvider`** component to configure the library:

```jsx
import { StyledProvider } from 'dank-style;

const config = {
  breakpoints: {
    xs: 0,
    sm: 600,
    md: 960,
    lg: 1280,
    xl: 1920
  },
  theme: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'blue',
      secondary: 'green'
    }
  }
};

const App = () => (
  <StyledProvider config={config}>
    <YourApp />
  </StyledProvider>
);
```

- In this example, the **`StyledProvider`** component is used to set the breakpoints and theme for the entire application, and the **`config`** prop is passed with the configuration options.
- It's important to note that the **`StyledProvider`** needs to be placed at the top level of your application, so that it can provide the config to all the other components that use the library.
- Once you have wrapped your application with the **`StyledProvider`**, you will be able to use the breakpoints, theme and other configs throughout your application.
