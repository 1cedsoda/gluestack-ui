# Install in Expo project

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps required to add gluestack-ui to your Expo project.

## Automatic Installation

If you are starting with a new project, you can directly install the template

#### Using custom command

```bash
npx create-expo-app-with-gluestack-ui@latest
```

OR

#### Using create expo app

```bash
yarn create expo-app --template @gluestack/expo-template
```

The above command will create a new Expo project with all the components of gluestack-ui installed and configured.

You can directly use all the components of gluestack-ui in your project.

## Manual Installation

You can create a new Expo project using [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/). We will cover initial setup, configuring the provider, and adding a new component.

### Step 1: Installation and Initial Setup

First, install the latest version of gluestack-ui in your project. This can be done using the following command:

```bash
npx gluestack-ui@latest
```

This command performs the following tasks:

- Checks if gluestack-ui is already installed in the project. If not, it creates a new `gluestack-ui.config.ts` file at the root of your project. This file contains the default theme which is used by all the components.
- Creates a `GluestackUIProvider`, a wrapper component.
- Add a `styled` function created using [FontResolver](https://style.gluestack.io/docs/plugins/fonts-plugin) and [AnimationResolver](https://style.gluestack.io/docs/plugins/animation-plugin) plugins.
- Installs the required dependencies: `@gluestack-style/react`, `@gluestack-style/animation-plugin`, and `@gluestack-ui/provider`.

### Step 2: Configure the GluestackUIProvider

The `GluestackUIProvider` is a component that provides aliases and tokens throughout your app, using React's Context API. It should be added to the root of your app.

You can update your `App.tsx` file as follows:

```jsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { GluestackUIProvider } from './components';
import { config } from './gluestack-ui.config';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GluestackUIProvider config={config.theme}>
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </GluestackUIProvider>
  );
}
```

This ensures that all components are wrapped with `<GluestackUIProvider />`, and the theme from `gluestack-ui.config.ts` is applied.

This guide should help you get started with gluestack-ui in your expo project. If you run into any issues or have further questions, please refer to the official documentation or community forums.
