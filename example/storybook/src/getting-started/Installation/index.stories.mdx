# Installation

To get started with Gluetack, you can install it using `npx` and add any desired component package using npx `gluestack-ui add <package-name>`. For example, to add the button component package, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx gluestack-ui add button

```

This will install the `@gluestack-ui/button` package and add it to your project's dependencies. This will add the necessary code to your project, including importing the `createButton` function and creating a `Button` component using it.

After installing the component, you can use it in your app by importing it and rendering it in your JSX. For example:

```jsx
import { Button } from './components/button';
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button onPress={() => alert('Clicked!')}>Click me!</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

This will render a button component that can be clicked and will display an alert when clicked.
