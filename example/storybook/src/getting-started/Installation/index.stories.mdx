## Summary

Throughout this guide, we have provided detailed instructions on how to install `dank` in your Expo or Next.js application and configure its settings to ensure optimal performance. We highly recommend taking the time to familiarize yourself with the various aspects of dank, such as its configuration options and styled provider functionality, as well as the styled function.

To get started, we suggest reviewing the [config](https://www.dank.style/docs/configuration/theme-tokens) and [provider](https://www.dank.style/docs/getting-started/styled-provider) sections to gain a deeper understanding of aliases and tokens works. Once you have a solid grasp of these concepts, you can begin experimenting with the [styled](https://www.dank.style/docs/getting-started/styled) function and applying it to your project as needed.
