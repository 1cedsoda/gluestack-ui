# TypeScript

To enable TypeScript for aliases and tokens, weâ€™ll follow below steps:

```jsx
// Gluestack config
export const config = {
  aliases: {
    bg: 'backgroundColor',
    p: 'padding',
    m: 'margin',
		...
  },
	tokens: {
		colors: {
      rose50: '#fff1f2',
      rose100: '#ffe4e6',
			...
    },
		space: {
			'0': 0,
      '0.5': 2,
			...
		},
    fontSizes: {...},
    fonts: {...},
	}
} as const;

// Get the type of Config
type ConfigType = typeof config;

// Extend the internal styled config
declare module '@gluestack/ui-styled' {
  interface ICustomConfig extends ConfigType {}
}
```

`aliases`: Define any prop you want to expand style value, the key is alias and the value is style property which you want to resolve that alias.

`tokens`: Tokens in Design are the values or constants required to construct a design system. These values can represent **spacing**, **color**, **typography** etc. Design tokens help to achieve consistency in building user interfaces across all platforms.

### Steps to define config:

1. Define config with type assertion.

```jsx
const config = {
	aliases: {...},
	tokens: {...},
} as const
```

why type assertion?

Because we need information about the type of value to define the type of aliases and their corresponding tokens.
Example: We have alias `bg` which will be mapped to the `colors` token and has style property `backgroundColor`, so we have an internal property map for tokens (i.e. `backgroundColor` will map to `colors` internally) through which we will eventually define which alias will map to which token.

1. Get the type of config using `typeof` operator.
2. Extend the internal styled config interface `ICustomConfig`

### Anatomy of utility props

Utility props follow below patterns:

Utility props implemented in the above pattern only define some standards and also limit the number of types generated.

> Note: You can define them in any of the patterns you want, but above approach is recommended to follow.
